There are different methods to solve this algorithm. The hardest of among all is trying to find
unique element without using collections. Different methods:

1. Without using collections (At least N squared)
2. Using collections, Set 
3. Sorting the list and then finding elements adjacent to each other if they are equal. (n log n)

Things learnt from this algorithm

1. Cannot convert List<Integer> to arrayList using collection method. It has to be manually
converted to a native list
2. Hard to find unique elements in an array without using collections
